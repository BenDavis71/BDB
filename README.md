Both pieces of code require the nfl-big-data-bowl-2024 folder you can download from Kaggle in their file path (both in the same parent folder), but those files are too big to upload to github. So you'll need to download that from Kaggle and place it in the folder structure, then I guess use .gitignore or something.
